# BeginMachineLearning
Machine Learning through Python

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

Module wise exercise files are kept. Just open the ipynb files in your Jupyter notebook

###
This is my first attempt to create required exercise module to learn all the components. Feel free to contribute.
Create a fork, do the changes, add new files if you feel it is relevant and raise a pull request
